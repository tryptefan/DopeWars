                    <strong>The Basics</strong>
                    <p>In Dope Wars [1987] your objective is to make as much money selling drugs as possible in 30 days.
                        In order to maximize profits, you will need to buy drugs when they are cheap, and sell them when
                        they are expensive. In order to advance the date, (and reset drug prices) you will need to
                        travel to
                        different cities. Some cities have points of interest like the loan shark or the bank.
                        Traveling and dealing drugs, you will face all sorts of dangers, from crooked cops, to
                        fake&nbsp;drugs.</p>

                    <strong>The Interface</strong>
                    <p>The first page you'll see when you start a new game is the city page. Here you'll be able to see
                        what city you're in; the date; a listing of available drugs; and buttons to travel or visit the
                        unique
                        point of interest in that city. There are a few things to be aware of in the drug listings that
                        will help
                        make decisions:</p>

                    1. Quantity
                    <img src="../img/help1.svg" />
                    <p>The first number in a listing is the amount of that drug that you are holding. You can hold up to
                        100 of each drug.</p>

                    2. Price graph
                    <img src="../img/help2.svg" />
                    <p>After the drug name is the price graph. This shows the last 10 days of prices so you can quickly
                        glance and see if a drug is selling high or low.</p>

                    <strong>Dealing</strong>
                    <p>Click anywhere on a drug listing to bring up the dealing interface. Here you can switch between
                        buying and selling. When selling, you can see what you purchased the drug for in order to make
                        sure you're
                        going to make a profit. Note: the purchase price shows an average, so if you bought at multiple
                        prices, you will still be able to compare with the current price.</p>

                    <strong>Ending</strong>
                    <p>There are several ways to end the game; some more glamorous than others. If you make it to day
                        30,
                        your cash and money in the bank will be combined, and any outstanding debt will be removed. You
                        will then
                        be given an ending based on this combined total.</p>

                    <strong>Tips & Tricks</strong>
                    <p>1. Pay off your debt early. At 10%/day interest, debt can quickly become difficult to deal with,
                        and
                        Big Rick isn't the most understanding person.</p>

                    <p>2. Deposit excess cash in the bank. As you travel to different cities and deal drugs, you will
                        run
                        the risk of being assaulted and robbed. The less cash you have, the less an assailant can take.
                    </p>

                    <p>3. Carry an assortment of drugs. If you get robbed, the assailant will take a percentage of a
                        random
                        drug you're holding. If you are holding a valuable drug, it's a good idea to also carry some
                        cheaper
                        drugs to reduce the chances of losing the valuable drug.</p>

                    <p>4. Keep your eyes open. Occasionally something unexpected may happen...</p>
